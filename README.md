### Business need.

A HR manager wants a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis

---

### Summary View

The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis

#### Overview
The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:

Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.
Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.
Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)
Show the distribution of employees by city and state.
Demographics

#### The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:

Present the gender ratio in the company.
Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
Show the total number of employees within each age group.
Show the total number of employees within each education level.
Present the correlation between employeesâ€™s educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.
Income
The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:

#### Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
Present how the age correlate with the salary for employees in each department.
Employee Records View

### Detailed View

Provide a comprehensive list of all employees with necessary information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.
Users should be able to filter the list based on any of the available columns.

## Troubleshooting Process

####  Theme and Colors.
The theme selected to apply to this project is Dark. So for base colors I've chosen dark gray (#777777), a very light gray (#f5f5f5), and lastly for customs colors I've   chosen green (#03c4a1) and, to contrast, a pink (#c52a87)  

This solution has three phases:

####  Phase 1. Data Prepaparation
  - Step 1: Collect Data.
  - Step 2: Connect to Data
  - Step 3: Check Data Quality
  - Step 4: Check Data Types
  - Step 5: Understand & Explore Data

#### Phase 2. Data Analysis
  - Collect Data.
  - Connect to Data.
  - Data Modelling.
  - Check Data Quality.
  - Check Data Types.
  - Understand & Explore Data.

#### Phase 3. Storytelling
  - Analyse user Requirements and choosing charts.
  - Initial Format of the sheet.
  - Creation of Calculkated fields and testing sheet.
  - Building different charts.
  - Formatting charts.
